# Projecto

"This repository hosts a robust Configuration-Driven Cellular Automata Simulation Engine.The project provides a flexible environment for running various complex automata rules, visualized in a persistent 3D Voxel/Minecraft-style world.Key Architectural FeaturesDecoupled System: Strict separation of concerns between the logic and presentation layers.Dynamic Ruleset: The system supports dynamic rule assignment (e.g., 'Coral', 'Maze', etc.) which are fully persisted in the Django backend.Z-Autómata Capability: Advanced state management includes dynamic voxel height ($H$) as a rule-driven variable, allowing for the procedural generation of evolving 3D terrains and biomes.Total Persistence: All simulation parameters, including aesthetic settings (colors, heights) and camera configuration, are database-driven, ensuring complete reproducibility across sessions.Technologies: Angular (Frontend Rendering) and Django (Backend Engine)."

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
